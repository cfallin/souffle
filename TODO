- move relations, relationwrappers, symTable, and BDD to globals, with
  defs indexed by name; we'll declare 'externs' manually for each
  RAM statement .cpp file
- for each statement, generate a separate string of code:
  - externs for symtab, BDD, and any referenced relations + their wrappers
  - the code itself, in a separate method
  - take hash of this string and create a filename based on it
- in the toplevel 'run()', just generate a long line of calls to
  out-of-lined functions
- move regex helper stuff to a header

- adapt compilation step to compile multiple files
